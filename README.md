Mazer
=====


Trying to learn some elixir by generating some mazes.
My 4yo currently loves mazes and according to him he is a "mazer".
Uses [recursive depth first algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm#Depth-first_search)

mix Mazer X Y

e.g. mix Mazer 10 20
will give you a 10 by 20 maze.
